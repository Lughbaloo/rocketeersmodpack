This modpack is a healthy mix of technology, progression, and magic. 
The goal is to make progression feel rewarding, while providing plenty of content within each stage of gameplay.
There are a few main paths each player can take, and exploring multiple paths will reward the player with greater abilities at the cost of time. 
Will you shoot for the stars? Or you will bring the stars down to you?


An Overview of each Chapter:

Chapter : Stone Age

Starting from bashing stones against rocks, you struggle to survive your first few days within the world. Discover ways to purify water and scavange for edible plants. Work with thatch and clay for shelter and basic utensils. This stage teaches you the mechanics of the world that will heavily affect the rest of your time here.

Chapter: Bronze Age

Having acquired the ability to alloy weak metals into less weak metals, you can finally get to work without stopping every five seconds to replace a tool. Begin building your permanent residence and dabble in some basic machinery. Harness the wind and domesticate the flowing rapids to automate simple tasks. Eventually sit down and properly process some iron, and enjoy the boon of your labor.

Chapter : It's Honest Work

The farming chapter, this set of quests focuses on growing crops and tending livestock. It also encompasses cooking and culinary exploration. While it does not feed directly into another chapter, anyone passing through the farming chapter will find themselves situated for life with things like biofuel, extra hearts, food and drink, as well as plenty of materials to exponentially grow automated factories.
